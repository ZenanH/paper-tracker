# Docker Deployment

Local Compose builds use the version-independent image tag `paper-tracker:local`. Published GHCR releases use immutable version tags; the CI workflow validates Linux AMD64 and ARM64 before publishing the shared multi-platform tag.

Docker Compose is required. Setup uses a temporary Node.js container to prepare instance keys, so Node.js is not required on the host:

```sh
./scripts/setup.sh
```

By default, `paper-tracker-data/` contains `data/`, `secrets/`, and the non-secret `compose.env` file. AI settings are configured in the app; API keys are encrypted in the mounted database. If an existing instance is missing its encryption key, setup stops instead of generating a replacement.

Use the same environment file for subsequent Compose commands so the data path, port, and service UID stay consistent:

```sh
docker compose --env-file paper-tracker-data/compose.env ps
docker compose --env-file paper-tracker-data/compose.env logs --tail=50
```

Before rebuilding, stop the old web and worker services while keeping the data directory:

```sh
docker compose --env-file paper-tracker-data/compose.env down
docker compose --env-file paper-tracker-data/compose.env up -d --build
```

Never delete the mounted data or secrets directories during an upgrade. The web app and worker share a local SQLite database; do not move it to a cross-host network filesystem.

The web service binds to `127.0.0.1:3000` by default. For trusted Tailscale access, set `BIND_ADDRESS` to the host's Tailscale IP and `APP_URL` to the origin users actually open. Write-request origin checks rely on this value. Recreate the services after changing it; do not expose every host interface by default.

An isolated deployment check can use its own data directory and port:

```sh
PAPER_TRACKER_DATA=.local/docker-smoke/paper-tracker-data \
APP_URL=http://localhost:3010 WEB_PORT=3010 \
COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME=paper-tracker-smoke ./scripts/setup.sh
```

Compose starts `init` before `web` and `worker`. The worker has no published port; the web service exposes an HTTP health check.

## Health and Upgrades

The `web` health check calls `/api/ready` to verify the database and installation record. The worker health check requires a database heartbeat within 25 seconds. Both services should show `healthy` in `docker compose ps`. Docker does not automatically restart an unhealthy process; check logs, directory permissions, and available disk space. The worker has a 120-second shutdown grace period. An interrupted request releases its lease so the next worker can resume from its last committed checkpoint without consuming a retry.

When setup runs as root on a new instance, it prepares service directories for the default non-root UID/GID 1000. `PUID=0` is rejected. A regular user defaults to its own UID/GID. Re-running setup preserves the UID/GID in `compose.env`. If setting `PUID` or `PGID` explicitly, make sure that identity can write the host data directory and read the secret files. Do not use `chmod 777`. Setup waits for service health and exits with an error if initialization fails or health checks time out.

## Backup and Restore

Create a consistent online backup while the web and worker services are running:

```sh
docker compose --env-file paper-tracker-data/compose.env exec -T web node dist/scripts/backup.js
```

Backups are written under `paper-tracker-data/data/backups/<snapshot-id>/`. A complete snapshot contains `COMPLETE`, `manifest.json`, and independently gzipped 16 MiB raw blocks. Transfer only completed snapshot directories. If a block is missing or damaged, retransmit that block while keeping the others. Restore verifies each block's length and SHA-256, the full database hash, SQLite integrity and foreign keys, and decryption of the stored AI key. Backups are not encrypted; protect them with host filesystem permissions.

Back up `secrets/` separately and securely. Restore requires the original instance keys. The following command restores into a new `restore-check` directory without changing the live database:

```sh
docker compose --env-file paper-tracker-data/compose.env exec -T web \
  node dist/scripts/restore.js \
  /app/instance/data/backups/<snapshot-id> \
  /app/instance/data/restore-check
```

After verification, stop the old web and worker services, point a new instance at the restored data directory, mount the original secrets read-only, then run initialization and start the services. You may also move the restored database into a prepared instance data directory while the services are stopped. Never overwrite a live database with restore files or combine an old WAL/SHM file with a restored database. Restore fails if the target exists, a block is missing, or the keys do not match; do not delete an active instance to bypass an error.

From a source checkout, use `pnpm backup [output-directory]` and `pnpm restore <snapshot-directory> <new-data-directory>`. Set `PAPER_TRACKER_HOME` and `ENCRYPTION_KEY_FILE` to the original instance. Restore preserves installation time, follows, archive/favorite states, and AI results; it clears the old worker heartbeat so unfinished tasks can resume from their lease and checkpoints.
